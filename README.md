# Vehicle-Recognition
a program to recognize vehicle models from the input image.   
   
I made this back in uni so it might not be the best but it works.  
it uses fast R-CNN with 6 layers. I trained and tested it on the stanford cars dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eduardo4jesus/stanford-cars-dataset). it includes a simple UI to browse for the image then it displays the model and year of the car. I included the annotations and the codes. just download the dataset from the link (2GB+) or use your own.
